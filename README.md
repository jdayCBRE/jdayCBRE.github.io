### GithubExplorer, written three ways

GithubExplorer is a simple mobile app with a few features that exercise common mobile development patterns, including:
- Login/logout and user state management
- Network requests to a REST API (`api.github.com`)
- JSON decoding
- Display of network fetched information in a list/table format
- Modern information architecture with bottom tabbed navigation, and master/detail view navigation (tapping on a list item to see details)
- Display and manipulation of images fetched from the internet

### Development
I wrote this app three ways:
- [React Native (iOS and Android)](https://github.com/jdayCBRE/GithubExplorer_ReactNative)
- [Native iOS](https://github.com/jdayCBRE/GithubExplorer_iOS)
- [Native Android](https://github.com/jdayCBRE/GithubExplorer_Android)

All three codebases are available and completely functional. Feel free to clone a project and check them out.
